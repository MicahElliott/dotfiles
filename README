= The OCD HOME FHS =

(This info also exists on Micah Elliott's blog.)

This is the "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Home" project.  It is
pedantically rigid in its organization, hence the name.  It is the root
of a few types of things:

 1. version control managed
 2. separate projects that are indivdually VCS-managed
 3. backed up/duplicated
 4. junk (may be large, don't care if it disappears)

Things placed under Mercurial (version) control (1) are those which meet
these criteria (see Breakdown and Key below):

 * need to have them everywhere
 * critical code I'm working on that is not in a separate project
 * small enough to keep track of an easily manage

Things not suited for VC are accessed via symlinks to a shared
area.  That area is regularly sent off to a couple of removable
drives in near and remote locations.

Machines tied into HOME VCS:

 * bigd (home, center)
 * blivet (work)
 * scxl13, and all other machines on storg NIS (work)
 * mdelliot-ubuntu (mobile)
 * mdelliot-mobl1 (mobile)
 * web6 (webfaction.com)

Breakdown of directory structure:

 * README*    -- this file
 * bin*       -- small (usually standalone) scripts that I have written
 * config*    -- VCS-manageable, user-written CONFIGuration (mostly dot-files)
 * contrib*   -- other people's scripts that need to be under my control
 * cron*      -- machine-specific structure supporting all CRON jobs
 * doc*       -- text DOCuments I write, books, presentations, personal logs
 * etc*       -- system-specific symlinks to important sytem ETC files
 * proj**^    -- PROJects (or *any* code) I'm working on
 * archive^   -- tarballs, extracts, checkouts
 * artwork^   -- anything related to graphics; binary so not in VCS
 * client^    -- work done for development/consulting CLIENTs
 * exp^       -- small-scale code/tests I'm working on only EXPerimentally
 * data^      -- generated, machine-specific config DATA files
 * log^       -- holds LOGs: installs, runs, reports
 * Documents^ -- binary DOCUMENTS, books, presentations
 * Books^     -- EPUBs to be shared with other devices
 * Mail^      -- all the mutt-managed MAIL
 * Music^     -- songs, podcasts, etc
 * Photos^    -- still shots (most mirrored to Flickr)
 * Videos^    -- VIDEOS, screencasts (mirror to vimeo/viddler?)
 * local!     -- my LOCAL install tree (... --prefix=~/local)
 * outgoing!  -- temp queue for things (forSOMEONE.tgz) sent to others
 * tmp!       -- a manual trash can
 * Downloads! -- temp holding area
 * .*         -- 100s more dot-files/dirs not worth tracking or listing here

Key:  * = $HOME-VCS-managed;         ^ = symlink-mirrored, not suited for VCS;
     ** = individually VCS-managed;  ! = lose-able;

Anything VCS-managed should be able to be used on any system that clones
it.

Old development dirs no longer in use: django, src, sandbox, public_html 

This setup enables the following special systems to work:

 * flexible cron
 * shared shell
 * ease of backup
 * ease of duplication
 * versioning of anything editable
 * independent repositories living inside home tree
 * versioning of system files
 * exclusion from VCS of anything large
