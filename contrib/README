contrib/bin README

This is a place for other people's scripts.  The name "contrib"
basically means that someone other than I wrote it -- it's contrib-uted
to my repo by someone else.  Cases where scripts end up in here include:

 * I had to hack it up to get to behave as I needed.  Now I can use my
   VCS to see all my diffs from the original version, and even "rebase"
   on external updates if worth it.

 * Not part of a full project package (which are installed to ~/local).

 * Not available as a .deb (if it were I'd just 'agi' it everywhere).

 * I need to have it installed everywhere, to save having to install
   some package on every machine/acct.
