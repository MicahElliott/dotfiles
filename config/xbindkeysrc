# A list of keys is in /usr/include/X11/keysym.h and in
# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h 
# The XK_ is not needed. 
#
# List of modifier (on my keyboard): 
#   Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock), 
#   Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4, Mod5 (Scroll). 
#
# Another way to specifie a key is to use 'xev' and set the 
# keycode with c:nnn or the modifier with m:nnn where nnn is 
# the keycode or the state returned by xev 
#
# This file is created by xbindkey_config 
# The structure is : 
# # Remark 
# "command" 
# m:xxx + c:xxx 
# Shift+... 




#keystate_numlock = enable
#keystate_scrolllock = enable
#keystate_capslock = enable



# control+shift+d starts an xterm (it's a comment)
"xterm"
   control+shift + q

# Note that SHLVL will be way down at depth 3 due to two subshell firings.
# If command is simple, the whole thing should just go here instead of
# into another subshell. Well, exec in the script partially does the
# trick, but still interesting that fired subshell inherits full env
# from shell where ‘xbindkeys’ is invoked.
"my-term"
   Control_R

"my-term 60x12"
   Shift + Control_R

#foo2
"xterm"
    m:0x4 + c:37
    Control + Control_L
