# Maria

Oh how long have I loved Maria?
Oh how long must I wait, Maria?
Oh how long have I tried, Maria?

Please come by.
How can I just wait for you when you don’t answer me.

Why you always sigh?

Let me pour/buy you a sangria.
I’ll go back to sangria.

Give me the next dance.
Give me a chance... again.

Porque hace fria?

Oh Mari-i-a.
