# Enable multiple syntax files

Key is use of oldie-goldie
[aftersyntax](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3064), which
I've just frozen locally as part of my vim.

Goal is to enable things like `comments.vim` to be used by any source file.
It requires that every language filetype has an appropriately named file, so
I'm just using silly symlinks for every language I want to enable.
