# binstubs â€” generate binstub symlinks for a set of dirs

# Some discussion:
# https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs
#
# So this is just a simplified version using symlinks instead of setting up
# environments. Really only useful for standalone scripts, which many gists
# are.
#
# Suffers from fixed base dir due to `ln` not being able to work outside of
# cwd, and don't want to cd all around at this point. And several other
# shortcoming.
