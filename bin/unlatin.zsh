# unlatin â€” convert file with latin encoding to utf-8

# Various tools (sed, CSV parsers) require extra work when dealing with
# ISO-8859 (latin), so this script converts safely to UTF-8. Run this in a
# pipeline when input encoding types are questionable.
#
# Typical encoding values from the `file` command are:
# * UTF-8
# * ASCII
# * ISO-8859

fl=${1?Must provide arg}
bak=$fl.orig

# Have to do this first as separate section, since removing nbsp could
# (gladly) down-convert the file to ascii.
if file -b $fl |grep -q 8859; then
  print "Removing possible nbsp chars."
  # Convert nasty pseudo-spaces (&nbsp;) to ascii spaces.
