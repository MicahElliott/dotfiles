~/bin README

This bin directory should always be in PATH, probably towards then end,
so as not to hide any system commands.  File names should not clash with
system commands.  It contains mostly Micah's personally written scripts.

Bash scripts don't need a .sh suffix.  Vim and others will do the right
thing.  However, Python, Perl, etc should have an indicative prefix so
that find, Vim, tidy, tests, etc, will do the right things.  If a Bash
script needs to be 'source'd, it should have a .sh suffix and be not
executable.  Everything to be "run" should be executable.
